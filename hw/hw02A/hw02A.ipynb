It will cause errors when we run the autograder, and it will sometimes cause a failure to generate the PDF file.\n",

You can do that, but the more typical way is to use `pd.to_datetime` (documentation [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.to_datetime.html)).

This particular format specifies that we would like our `pd.TimeStamp`s in the form `Month`/`Day`/`Year` `Hour`(12-hr)/`Minute`/`Second` `AM/PM`"

    "# 4: Benford's Law\n",
    "\n",
    "[Benford’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law), also known as the Law of Anomalous Numbers or the First Digit Law, is a phenomenon seen in many real-world datasets. In datasets where Benford’s Law applies, there is an overrepresentation of small numbers (e.g., 1 and 2) in the leading digits of numeric entries and an underrepresentation of large numbers (e.g., 8 and 9). Benford’s Law is observed in river lengths, national populations, and has even been used to investigate [financial fraud](https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=what-is-benfords-law-and-why-fraud-examiners-use-it)! More about Benford’s Law can be found [here](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-benfords-law-why-this-unexpected-pattern-of-numbers-is-everywhere/).\n",
