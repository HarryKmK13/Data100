    "Write a SQL query to determine the movie producers with the highest average ratings across all of their movies. Define a **\"movie producer\"** as anyone with a `producer` job category role in a `movie` title type. Construct a query that generates a table consisting of the **producer's name** (as `name`) and their **average producer rating** (as `producerRating`), computed by rescaling the ratings for movies they produced by the number of votes received by each movie. After rescaling the score for each movie, divide the summation of all rescaled ratings by the total number of votes received by each producer. The formula is below:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{producerRating} = \n",
    "\\frac{\\sum_m (\\text{averageRating}[m] * \\text{numVotes}[m] )}{\\sum_m \\text{numVotes}[m]}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To make clear the summation, \"m\" refers to a particular movie that a producer worked on. Thus, the summation over \"m\" refers to the summation across all movies that a particular producer contributed to.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the above, only consider ratings where there are **at least 22,500** votes and only consider movie producers that have **at least 20 rated movies**. Present the producers with the **top 10** `producerRating` in **descending** order and break ties alphabetically using the producer's name.\n",
